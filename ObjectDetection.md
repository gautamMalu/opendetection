![Object Recognition](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/examples/bottle_05.jpg)

Usually there are fixed number of classes which an algorithm can recognize (Car, dog, Human, Bike etc). It depends on which dataset the algorithm has been trained. There are two dataset on which are used for benchmarking of object recognition algorithms. Early algorithms have focused only on single object class such as face detection, or pedestrian detection. Here is the summary table of bechmarking datasets:

| Dataset Name        | # object categories           | # Training Images  |Website |
